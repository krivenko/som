This program is an optimized implementation of an analytic continuation
method proposed by Andrey S. Mishchenko. A detailed description of
the method can be found in
<http://www.cond-mat.de/events/correl12/manuscripts/mishchenko.pdf>.

SOM 2.x offers new features, including the more advanced SOCC ([stochastic
optimization with consistent constraints](
https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.014102)) analytic continuation protocol.

SOM uses the TRIQS library version 3.2.x or 3.3.x. The TRIQS website is under
<https://triqs.github.io/triqs/>. Start there to learn about TRIQS.

**Legacy SOM versions 1.x are based on TRIQS 1.4.2. The 1.x source code is still
available on the `1.x` branch; Its respective documentation web-site
was moved to <https://krivenko.github.io/som1>**.

Installation
------------

Please, refer to <http://krivenko.github.io/som/install.html> or
`doc/install.rst` in the source code tree for installation instructions.
