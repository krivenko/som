TODO list for SOM 2.0
=====================

* Port codebase to TRIQS 2.x ([issue #5](https://github.com/krivenko/som/issues/5)).
* Implement the solution quality assessment technique proposed in Phys. Rev. B **95**, 014102 (2017).
* Add the anomalous Green's function kernels, as defined in CPC **215**, 149-155 (2017).
* Add an option to resume accumulation of particular solutions.
* Detach the energy mesh projection procedure from the the solver.
* Add an option to perform the energy mesh projection using binning.
* Optimize memory consumption during the energy mesh projection phase.
* Use a more size-efficient HDF5 storage format for particular solutions.
