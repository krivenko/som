Authors
-------

This analytic continuation package is written by Igor Krivenko
(companion papers [KH2019]_,
`arXiv:1808.00603 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00603>`_ and [KM2022]_).

It is based on a method devised by Andrey S. Mishchenko and coauthors
[MPSS2000]_. You can find a detailed description of the method in Chapter 14 of
the Lecture Notes from the Autumn School "Correlated Electrons: From Models to
Materials".

TRIQS
-----

It is highly recommended to get familiar with basic usage of the TRIQS library,
before starting to work with this program.

Here is a simple tutorial showing how to manipulate Green's function objects of
TRIQS in Python scripts,

I am very grateful to

- Malte Harland for extensive and thorough testing of the code at late
  development stages of SOM 1.0;
- Andrey S. Mishchenko, who stimulated work on SOM 2.0 and shared his knowledge
  about technical aspects of the method.

I would like to acknowledge support from the University of Hamburg, as well as
from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via the Project SFB-668
"Magnetismus vom Einzelatom zur Nanostruktur" (A3). Some large-scale tests have
been run on the JURECA HPC machine of the Forschungszentrum Jülich (project
"Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo for materials").

Credits to Snir Gazit, who suggested adding support for full covariance matrices
in SOM 2.0.
